# W207_Group2_FinalProject

### In this final project for Applied Machine Learning, our team chose a project involving predicting the popularity of pet pictures posted on an adoption website.

We tried several approaches, starting with a baseline linear regression and Naive Bayes, and we ultimately determined that neural networks using PySpark and TensorFlow yielded the best results. The entire project is documented in [this notebook](https://github.com/mattslyons/pet_pawpularity/blob/main/Final_group_2_submission_notebook_with_appendix.ipynb).
